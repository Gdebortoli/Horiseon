HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

On my own refreacted starter code HTML and CSS file to be accessible without 
changing the contents of the website. 

I was "hired" by a marketing agency to make their existing site more accesible so 
people with disabilies are able to know the contents and layout of a webpage. 

We were instructed to rework the HTML and CSS files to make them more efficient, 
consolidated and organized. 


This is the link we were meant to refreact and make more accessable. I used this as a reference.
